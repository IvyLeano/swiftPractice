//constants

//implicit types - the compliler infer its type

//explicit types
//used when the initial value does not provide enough information
//used when there is no initial value




//Notes:
// 1. values are never implicitly converted to another type - must do so explicity
// ex) let label = "The width is"
//    let width = 94
//    let widthLabel = label + String(width)
